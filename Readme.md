In javascript we can't access the last element of the array like other programming language by using [-1]....In javascript, [] is used to access both objects and arrays. Therefore, [-1] indicate the -1 position not the last element of the array.

so we can access the last element of the array in javascript using:
slice() method
pop() method
Reduce() method
Reverse() method
ForEach() method
